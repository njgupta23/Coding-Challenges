# Given a subset of node relationships in a graph, 
# determine if the relationships can be represented as a binary tree.


# Relationships will be represented as a list of tuple pairs where the
# parent is the first element and the child is the second.

# eg. [(parent_1, child_1), (parent_2, child_2), ... (parent_n, child_n)]
